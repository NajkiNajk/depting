## Reflection

This project was built in a few days. Project goals included using technologies and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

The main challenge was using Grid in this project, it was new to me so I spent time reading documentation and trying to learn how to successfully apply it.
But above all, it was a really good learning experience.

Due to the lack of time, I didn't manage to develop the responsive design for the menu & msg form. Regarding the logos of clients initially, they were sent as jpg files,
in order to apply the change on the background I was needed SVG or pdf file. That's why the background of the logos is different from the client's background.
I started creating the app to be component-based, but I know now that hooks are the most preferred way. In the future, I would use hooks instead of components.
